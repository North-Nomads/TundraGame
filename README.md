## TundraGame
A free-to-play tower defense mobile game about magic. 
This is our first practice project which has been grown up from the Gamedev Project Accelerator.
## Game status
Our game is still under development, so there could be bugs or crashes. 
Now it's in MVP state, that means the game mechanics can be not fully implemented and main part of game content and features will be added later.
If you found any bugs, you can contact us:
* Via DM (@TaggedDev, @IOExcept10n or @GalteXx)
* On our [Discord Server](https://discord.com) and [Telegram Channel](t.me/TundraDevLog)
* Or create a [bug report](https://github.com/North-Nomads/TundraGame/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%5BBUG%5D&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D)
Also if you have any improvements or ideas, write them using the same ways
